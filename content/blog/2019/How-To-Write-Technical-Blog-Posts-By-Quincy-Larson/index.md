Quincy Larson, and what he's done with [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), is amazing.

As I was on my latest of many iterations of getting this blog up and running, I rembered a talk I watched on Youtube some time ago given by Quincy.

The video is very much worth worth the 15 minute watch. Here's my outline of his talk.

## Create Substance

- Write something that matters
- All the buzzwords in the world can't save your writing if it doesn't have substance
- Do homework
- Know the topic you are writing about
- Know what's been written about the topic
- Even if a specific topic been heavily covered, there are many possible permutations

> Pro Tip: Expect to put an hour or more into every minute the reader will spend reading.

## Package for Consumption

What is packaging?

- Headline

  - Good one makes all the difference
  - If you're going to fine-tune one aspect, make it this

- Images

  - Recent study: 86% of top blog posts include at least one image

- Formatting

  - Break up text with subheads, pull quotes

- Platform

## Publicize Like Crazy
